# PROMPTS.md - eLearn decision-architecture project · Group [N]
**Members:** CC, Aarti, [CD], [EF]
**Live link:** https://super-management-university.vercel.app (Vercel Hobby, imported from the group repo on 2026-09-28)
**Tools used:** Aside with Claude Sonnet 5.5 subagents (named roles: Tim, coordinator; Art, designer; Rev, adversarial reviewer; Stick, compliance and requirements), plus Figma. Entries 1 to 28 were run with an AI browser agent (Aside) with access to the course folder and the logged-in LMS, from the start of the project to the draft paper. The Variant B plan named the university's Gemini account for starter prompts; that was proposed and is not built: no AI model runs in the prototype.
**How to read this log:** entries run in time order, from choosing the product (Entries 1 to 10), through ideation on the My Results page, 25 Oct (Entries 11 and 12; findings written up in the Google Doc "My findings"), the build and hand-off of Variant A (Entries 13 to 21), and the draft paper (Entries 22 to 28), to the one-site A/B build, the Version B redesign rounds, review, parity with Aarti's Version A, and deploy (Entries 29 to 64). Entry 58 does not exist: the working log skipped that number when it was made. Each entry has the prompt as sent, what came back, our judgement, and a principle check. The principle checks refer to the course readings and the course presentations in general terms on purpose. Text in square brackets is still to be filled in by the group.

---

## Entry 1 - pick a company · 2026-09-28, ~14:15 · sent by CC · Aside
```
Help us with the assignment for the term paper, we need to choose a company [...] Increase profit margin, policy intervention, mock up of current existing site and make it better from there. Need a KPI [...] 1. Purchase more frequency 2. Improve renewal [...] Ideas: Change eLearn? F & B company; google engine; Facebook
```
**What came back:** It suggested a grocery site (FairPrice Online) and said the LMS had "no profit or renewal".
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** We chose the LMS anyway. Renewal = weekly re-engagement and continuing to the next term.
**Principle check:** none: product choice only.

## Entry 2 - we're doing the LMS · 2026-09-28, ~14:25 · sent by CC · Aside
```
We're doing eLearn
```
**What came back:** A reframe (renewal = weekly engagement and retention; purchase = continuing education) and a first KPI table.
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** Accepted the renewal framing. Dropped the continuing-education upsell later (Entry 4) to keep to one decision.
**Principle check:** W2 goal setting (proposed), not yet checked against the course readings.

## Entry 3 - repo, course materials, KPIs, start · 2026-09-28, ~14:35 · sent by CC · Aside
```
we're doing eLearn, create a repo titled eLearn-improved or somethign, refer the course maerials , give is a list of KPIs to agree on then start ethe redesing
```
**What came back:** The agent read the syllabus, the early course presentations and the term-paper brief. It flagged three conflicts with the brief: (1) a real brand name is a trap, so it used the fictional "Wrenfield" brand and the repo name `wrenfield-learn` (renamed by CC on 2026-09-28 to "SMU - Super Management University", repo `super-management-university`); (2) variant B must wait until AUDIT.md is committed; (3) the brief wants one decision, not a whole site. It captured dated screenshots of the real LMS.
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** [CC to fill in]
**Principle check:** W1 pre-registration (A/B test order), as set out in the course brief.

## Entry 4 - narrow the scope · 2026-09-28, ~14:50 · sent by CC · Aside
```
Based off course readings, there should be some kind of goal gradient effect for the course readings completed. [...] Just do: Home page, Course page, PGPD registration. WE can ignore all else, but keep a track of .md files ignored
```
**What came back:** Variant A of the three screens, a consent screen and a debrief. SCOPE.md lists every ignored screen. A draft AUDIT.md has 10 findings; Finding 3 is the reading-list goal gradient ("100% complete" after one click).
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** [CC to fill in]
**Principle check:** W2 goal gradient, based on the course readings and the early course presentations.

## Entry 5 - status check · 2026-09-28, 16:51 · sent by CC · Aside
```
Status update
```
**What came back:** The Ideation deadline had moved to 11:59 PM that day. No new commits.
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** None.
**Principle check:** none: production only.

## Entry 6 - rename the brand; list the deliverables · 2026-09-28, ~17:00 · sent by CC · Aside
```
Don't call it wrenfield, call it SMU - Super Management University. check what else the assignemnt is asking for as a delievrable
```
**What came back:** The brand, logo mark and repo were renamed (`super-management-university`). The agent warned that "SMU" matches the real university's initials, so markers may read it as the real brand, and suggested we explain the parody in the paper. It also listed every deliverable in the brief.
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** [CC to fill in]
**Principle check:** none: production only.

## Entry 7 - A from screenshots · 2026-09-28, ~17:50 · sent by CC · Aside
```
for now, what you can do is take screenshots of the current eLearn page and use that on the web site, say because of the MS365 security issue we were unable to created version A which was the source copy as accurately, so we used screenshots and prompting instead
```
**What came back:** Four fresh full-page screenshots (Home, course home, Content › Course Readings, PGPD). The student name, avatar, one password shown on a page and a staff name were removed before capture. Variant A showed these images with clickable areas. A method note is on the consent screen and in AUDIT.md, SCOPE.md and README.md. The HTML rebuild stays in the repo as the base for B.
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** [CC to fill in]
**Principle check:** none: production only. Risk noted: the screenshots show the real university logo, which the brief warns against.

## Entry 8 - host on Vercel, keep private · 2026-09-28, ~18:10 · sent by CC · Aside
```
Once this is done, do not share it with the professor; private repo, host it on vercel, share me the link
```
**What came back:** Imported to Vercel (Hobby, Vite preset). Live at https://super-management-university.vercel.app. The repo stays private.
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** [CC to fill in]
**Principle check:** none: production only.

## Entry 9 - A/B toggle in the masthead · 2026-09-28, ~18:25 · sent by CC · Aside
```
I want to view optioni A vs B as a toggle on the masthead
```
**What came back:** A dark bar at the top with "A Current / B Redesign". It shows only on links with ?v= (review links). The bare URL, which participants get, keeps random assignment and hides the bar, so testers cannot switch arms. B shows a "not built yet" card listing the planned repairs. The debrief code marks a toggled session with "t".
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** [CC to fill in]
**Principle check:** W1 randomisation: a switcher visible to testers would break the A/B test, so it is review-only.

## Entry 10 - no result code · 2026-09-28, ~19:18 · sent by CC · Aside
```
I dont wnat to enter a code, just a or b   [with a screenshot of the debrief's "A-A-3-5-4-x-x-7" result code]
```
**What came back:** The result code is removed. The debrief now says only "You saw design A" (or B), with one line on what that design is.
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** [CC to fill in]
**Principle check:** W1 test plan: answers are no longer captured in the app, so the pilot needs a form or a facilitator (AUDIT.md open question 5).

## Entry 11 - ideation: walk the My Results page as the user · 2026-10-25, [time] · sent by Aarti · Aside
```
[with a screenshot of the My Results page, 25 Oct 2026. Not reproduced here because it shows a real name and campus ID.]
Above is a screenshot of the My Result page. Walk it as the user, keeping in mind that it's for decision architecture: how each element is influencing the user to make a decision through eLearn.
```
**What came back:** A walk-through of the page as the student. The My Result audit that followed (Google Doc "My findings", dated 31 Oct) opens by naming the one decision the page serves: after seeing my result, where do I stand in this course, and what do I do next? The options are to request a review, change effort on what remains, or do nothing. It then went element by element: the result table, the blank columns, the raw score, the class comparison, the labels, the header with name and ID. [Aarti to check this summary against the chat reply.]
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** The walk-through showed that the page serves the decision poorly, so the findings were written up element by element, in six lines each, in the Google Doc "My findings" (Entry 12).
**Principle check:** W2 goal setting, W3 expectations, W4 framing and defaults, applied as in the course readings and presentations; Nielsen's heuristics used as a separate lens.

## Entry 12 - ideation: what is missing on My Results · 2026-10-25, [time] · sent by Aarti · Aside
```
I noticed that the My Results page did not have any sort of goal. It did not have any sort of bar or mark to show where we currently are compared to the class average. There was no dashboard. There should have been a dashboard.
Second, it does not show the class average. If it showed the class average, I feel it would give some kind of motivation. It could backfire too, but there should be something, some kind of dashboard.
It also shows results only until one semester, say semester one or semester two, but it should show all results from semester one onwards, until semester four or five, so you can see the gradual progress, or where you are lacking, and subject-wise.
It should also break down my score component by component. Right now only some subjects show the components; for every subject it should show the component-wise grading.
It should include the behavioural audit, six lines, for each finding and feature.
```
**What came back:** The Google Doc "My findings" (the My Result audit, later dated 31 Oct): eleven findings, each in six lines (where; what the user sees and does; principle and reading; mechanism and whose goal wins; severity; repair), with a summary table of severities. The highest-rated (severity 3) were the empty Grade, Weight, Average, Min and Max columns, the raw "11/15" with no link to the course goal, and no next step after the result. The class average was written up as a reference point that could help or backfire depending on where the student sits, with a "Compare with class" toggle as the repair. [Aarti to confirm this is the reply to this prompt.]
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** Two of the observations in this prompt are not yet in the audit: (a) results are shown for one semester at a time, with no progress view across all semesters and subjects; (b) the score is broken into components for some subjects only. They should become two new My Results findings with six lines each and repair codes. [to fill in]
**Principle check:** W2 goal gradient (no goal bar or dashboard); W3 expectations (blank columns); W4 reference points and W9 social norms (class average, which can motivate or discourage, and may differ by group, W10), all as in the course readings and presentations.

## Entry 13 - rebuild Variant A from the live site as an offline page · 2026-11-06, [time not recorded] · sent by Aarti · Aside
```
[Exact prompt to be pasted. It asked for an offline, standalone HTML copy of eLearn with the sample course MGMT6108 and the global pages, with inline CSS and JavaScript, checked against the live site on desktop and phone for content, structure, geometry, styles, interactions and breakpoints, including menus and dropdowns on both layouts.]
```
**What came back:** A standalone page with no network calls. The university name became "Your University" with a neutral crest, the account name "Student", staff names "Sample Instructor" and "Sample Staff", and emails student@example.com. Measured breakpoints on the live site were 767 px (phone drawer) and 1099 px (tablet to desktop). The first pixel comparison averaged about 5% on desktop and 9% on phone, mostly because the first capture used a different root font size from the live site.
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** We re-captured at the live font size. [to fill in]
**Principle check:** none: production only. Privacy: the masking was part of the build, because the real account shows a name and campus ID (see the background section of the paper).

## Entry 14 - narrow Variant A to one sample course · 2026-11-07, 00:58 · sent by Aarti · Aside
```
[Exact prompt to be pasted. It dropped the three older courses from Variant A, kept Decision Science (MGMT6108) as the one sample course, said it is fine to present the data as sample data, and asked for the eLearn pages only, not the worst screens.]
```
**What came back:** The three older courses were archived and left out of the page (they also returned 403 on the live site). The page covers 76 screens in three layouts (phone 390 px, tablet 820 px, desktop 1440 px). Grades is marked "not capturable" because the live site returned 403 for this account. A later audit run averaged about 1.8% pixel difference on desktop, 2.4% on tablet and 3.0% on phone, and the page is marked Incomplete because not every check passes yet.
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** [to fill in]
**Principle check:** none: production only.

## Entry 15 - prepare a hand-off copy · 2026-11-07, 10:19 · sent by Aarti · Aside
```
[Exact prompt to be pasted. It said the work was being handed to someone else, asked for the relevant files in a folder titled "To share", and asked for personal identifiers to be removed from the shared copy.]
```
**What came back:** A "To share" folder with the standalone page, a sitemap, a hand-off note and a clean project copy. Personal identifiers were scrubbed: a Windows user name in a path, real staff and instructor names, the account name in the masking rules, and two other course codes. The masking rules now read names from an environment variable. A rebuild from the shared copy gave the same 76 screens.
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** [to fill in]
**Principle check:** none: privacy handling.

## Entry 16 - commit Variant A to the repo · 2026-11-07, 10:30 · sent by Aarti · Aside
```
commit version a to this git hub repo : https://github.com/c-c-for-code/super-management-university
commit version a changes to this repo https://github.com/c-c-for-code/super-management-university
```
**What came back:** Git was not installed on this machine, so the files were added through GitHub's web upload in the signed-in browser. A new folder `version-a-elearn/` holds the standalone page `elearn_version_a.html`, `sitemap.md`, `handoff.md`, `session_handoff.json`, `BOOT.md` and the build scripts. It sits outside `public/`, so the deployed page was not changed.
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** [to fill in] Note: this entry paraphrases the first request, so check it against the chat.
**Principle check:** none: production only.

## Entry 17 - replace the old Variant A with the finalized folder · 2026-11-07, 10:54 · sent by Aarti · Aside
```
Can you update the GitHub repo with the contents in this device, this particular folder? Ignore version A that was old, replace it entirely with what we finalized here.
If the issue is a web approves 25 MB file limit, break it down and then upload the shared.json file. Do this for other files as well. I just want the version A uploaded alone. Ignore deployment on Vercel.
```
**What came back:** The folder "To share" (257 files) was uploaded as `version-a-elearn/`, replacing the earlier partial upload. The one file over the 25 MB web limit, `shared.json` (57 MB), was split into three parts (20, 20 and 17 MB); `build.js` reads the parts directly. Every uploaded file was fetched back and matched the local copy byte for byte. Vercel was not touched.
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** [to fill in]
**Principle check:** none: production only.

## Entry 18 - delete the old Variant A · 2026-11-07, 11:47 · sent by Aarti · Aside
```
Delete the old version A screenshots and the old version A files. I just want the new version A files to be stored on the repo alone.
[answer to the follow-up question "what should the repo hold when I'm done?": "Keep B, remove old A"]
```
**What came back:** The four screenshots in `public/a/` were deleted. Variant A was cut out of `public/index.html` (its screens and clickable areas, the A/B toggle, the V and H keys, 43 of the 54 embedded screenshots); the page went from 5.4 MB to 1.4 MB. Variant B was kept. In a local test all 54 B screens showed the same text as before and there were no console errors. Entering `?v=A` or an old `#a/` link now opens B.
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** [to fill in] Note: the deployed page no longer has an A arm for the A/B test (AUDIT.md, 2026-11-07).
**Principle check:** W1 randomisation: without an A arm on the page the test cannot run as planned; the group needs to decide how A is shown to testers.

## Entry 19 - bring the four notes up to date · 2026-11-07, 12:05 · sent by Aarti · Aside
```
edit them as well- merge these 4 files of old version a with new version B
```
**What came back:** `AUDIT.md` got a dated entry under "Added after building" and nothing above that heading changed. `SCOPE.md` now describes the new variant A and keeps the screenshot approach as "earlier approach". `README.md` was updated in the previous step. This file got entries for the repo steps. `REFLECTION.md` got a dated note. The notes were kept as four separate files, because the brief asks for them by name; they were not combined into one.
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** [to fill in]
**Principle check:** none: documentation only.

## Entry 20 - save the session archive · 2026-11-07, 12:14 · sent by Aarti · Aside
```
download and save in a new folder
```
**What came back:** The session archive (a JSON record of the Variant A work) was saved to a new "Session archive" folder and checked byte for byte against the original.
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** The request did not name a file, so the choice of file was an assumption. [to fill in]
**Principle check:** none: production only.

## Entry 21 - add the Variant A page and the four notes to the archive · 2026-11-07, 12:27 · sent by Aarti · Aside
```
the elearn html also as the well 4 notes
```
**What came back:** The Variant A page and the four notes (AUDIT.md, PROMPTS.md, REFLECTION.md, SCOPE.md) were added to the "Session archive" folder, taken from the repo and checked byte for byte.
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** [to fill in]
**Principle check:** none: production only.

## Entry 22 - draft paper from the brief · 2026-11-07, 17:20 · sent by Aarti · Aside
```
use the above pasted text and create the term paper sample.
[the pasted text was the full term-paper brief: Parts I to XIV, covering the audit method, a nine-column audit table, a nine-column redesign table, a week-by-week matrix, a nudge-not-sludge check, prioritisation, a test plan and the required paper structure]
```
**What came back:** A 27-page draft (PDF and Word): homepage plus seven features, a nine-column audit table, a nine-column redesign table for Variant B, a week-by-week matrix, a nudge-not-sludge check, a prioritisation matrix, a test plan, limitations and references. Every journal reference was checked against Crossref; one reference that could not be verified was kept out of the list. The agent said the seven features were inferred from the group's module split because the official list was not in the files, and that severities were one rater's proposals.
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** [to fill in] We corrected the presentation references the agent had cited, and removed a figure from a screen that rendered only as a loading placeholder in the Variant A page.
**Principle check:** W2 to W10 applied as in the course readings and presentations; Nielsen's ten heuristics as a separate column.

## Entry 23 - audit format: current design, proposed redesign, then the nine-column table · 2026-11-07, [time] · sent by Aarti · Aside
```
Follow the screenshot that I have sent for each of the elements or each of the pages. Just mention the current design right now and what our proposed redesign is, and then the table whose format I'm copy-pasting.
[with a screenshot of the Discussions tab prompt (current experience, proposed redesign) and the nine-column audit-table specification: Where; What the user sees and does; Behavioural principle; Heuristic concept; Mechanism, whose goal wins; Verdict; Severity (0 to 4); Repair, with a unique repair code per finding; Prediction. Rules: one finding per row, evidence from the actual interface, positive findings documented as positives, no invented severities or percentages, predictions kept apart from results.]
```
**What came back:** A separate audit document with a "current experience / proposed redesign" block for each element, then the nine-column table with a repair code on every row. The six findings from the My Result audit that were missing were added. All predicted percentages were removed. Severity ratings from the My Result audit were marked as the member's ratings; every other rating was marked as one rater's proposal.
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** [to fill in]
**Principle check:** one finding per element, as in the course audit method; behavioural principles and heuristics kept in separate columns.

## Entry 24 - Variant B's core idea from the group call · 2026-11-07, [time] · sent by Aarti · Aside
```
use the transcript and make changes accordingly.
Version B's core idea: Make eLearn habit forming
[with the transcript of a group call. Not reproduced because it contains member names.]
```
**What came back:** The paper now states B's core idea (make eLearn habit forming, with a minimalist layout, a left-pane dashboard of enrolled courses, breadcrumbs, gamification across readings, quizzes, participation, discussion posts and assignments, a progress tree in the style of a well-known app, rewards, badges, a mascot with prompts and reminders, and a larger AI role in quizzes). A new finding (HB1: no recurring prompt or reward for routine actions) supports it. The nudge-not-sludge check passes a growth-only tree, student-set reminders and criterion-based badges, passes variable rewards only with guards, and does not pass a tree that falls, a rank-based "top 5%" line or the loss bar as described. The agent also added an AI-tools table, an ideation-process section, a walk-through as the user and as the architect for each page, and moved each screenshot next to its page.
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** Two terms in the call were unclear in the transcript and are not relied on. The habit layer is described from the call, not seen in a prototype. [to fill in]
**Principle check:** W2 goal gradient; partial reinforcement and the behaviour model as set out in the class notes and readings; W9 social norms for badges; loss framing (W4) for the falling tree.

## Entry 25 - split the findings table by module · 2026-11-07, [time] · sent by Aarti · Aside
```
break the table for finidngs module wise too- it's too long currently
```
**What came back:** Table 1 was split into ten module tables (1a to 1j): Homepage, Course Home, Content, Assignments, Quizzes, Discussions, ClassList, My Results in two parts, and a cross-page table for the habit finding. The 29 findings and the nine columns are unchanged.
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** The redesign table (Table 2) is still one long table; it can be split the same way if needed. [to fill in]
**Principle check:** none: layout only.

## Entry 26 - paper: introduction, core idea, current design per page · 2026-11-07, [time] · sent by Aarti · Aside
```
Prompts for term paper, which come after version A and the ideation process:
Introduction: decision architecture is seen in day-to-day life. As students, eLearn is something we use daily and it impacts us, which is why we chose it (more about motivation, and why it is currently weak). The core idea is that we want eLearn to be habit forming, with greater motivation and gamification.
Background: ideation process (leave this, I will add it in).
Then finally the proposed redesign:
For each page, the current design: identified elements, how it is currently lacking, element severity level, relation to the course week and readings, and the missing element.
Mention concepts such as goal gradient, progress, confirmation bias etc. wherever relevant.
```
**What came back:** [Not yet applied when this entry was written.] The v4 draft already has the introduction on decision architecture and why we chose eLearn, the habit-forming core idea, and a current-design section for each page (elements, severity, week and reading link, missing element). Confirmation bias appears only as a B element with no finding behind it (Table 5). [to update after the next edit]
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** To do: tie the introduction more clearly to students' daily use and to why the current design is weak on motivation; add goal gradient, progress and confirmation bias wherever a finding supports them, and add a finding for confirmation bias if the screens support one. [to fill in]
**Principle check:** W2 goal gradient and progress; W3 confirmation bias and expectations; W4 framing, all as in the course readings and presentations.

## Entry 27 - paper: the seven audit steps on the main pages, and the redesign in six lines · 2026-11-07, [time] · sent by Aarti · Aside
```
Then also mention the 7 steps of the behavioural audit done (where, walk it as the user, etc. - see the My Results page uploaded in Google Drive), but this needs to be done for main pages such as the homepage, assignments, discussions.
Then the proposed redesign, explained, especially the why and whom it benefits (goal served for the user and the company). Each finding gets 6 lines in the proposed redesign (Variant B screenshot).
```
**What came back:** [Not yet applied when this entry was written.] The v4 draft lists the seven steps in a table (what was done and what was only partly met) and has a "walk it as the user" and "walk it as the architect" row for every page. It does not yet show each main page's findings in the six-line format next to a Variant B screenshot, and the "why, and whom it benefits" is in Table 2 and the nudge-not-sludge check, not per finding.
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** To do: for the homepage, Assignments and Discussions, write each finding in six lines (where; what the user sees and does; principle; mechanism and whose goal wins; severity and driver; repair) and the proposed redesign in six lines, with the Variant B screen beside the Variant A screen. A Variant B screenshot is needed from the design file. [to fill in]
**Principle check:** the course audit method: one finding per element, six lines, severity with its driver; whose goal wins stated for the student and for the university.

## Entry 28 - paper: heuristic evaluation table and the background points · 2026-11-07, [time] · sent by Aarti · Aside
```
[from the group chat, with screenshots of the heuristic-evaluation material and of a checklist for choosing a product worth auditing]
Do a heuristic evaluation table too (but include it in the appendix, otherwise too long, but good to have this if you guys can, otherwise it's okay). In the main term paper, just mention the heuristic evaluation was done with it, showing __ in 1-2 lines.
In background we mention these 6 points, and how we masked the details for privacy concern in version A itself, reflected on decisions which affect students, and it has no real payment / data.
```
**What came back:** [Not yet applied when this entry was written.] The v4 draft has a table of the ten heuristics with where each was observed (in the main text, Table B), but no per-page heuristic evaluation table in an appendix, and the six checklist points are not yet in the background. The blank "__" needs a result from that table.
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** To do: move the heuristic table to an appendix as a per-page evaluation (each of the ten heuristics rated for each page: violated, weakly supported or implemented, with the finding code); in the main paper add one or two lines stating the evaluation was done and what it showed (for example, how many heuristics are violated on how many pages, once counted from the table); in the background, list the six checklist points as they apply (one decision that matters; screens we can capture and date; a real stake; users we can reach for a pilot; a fictional brand; no real payments or personal data) and explain that Variant A masks the university name, account name, staff names, emails and campus ID, that the decisions it shows affect students (deadlines, results, whom to work with), and that it contains no real payment or personal data. [to fill in]
**Principle check:** Nielsen's ten heuristics as a separate lens from the behavioural principles; the heuristic evaluation predicts problems and does not replace testing with users.

## Entry 29 - launch four Sonnet subagents (Tim, Stick, Art, Rev) · 2026-11-08, about 04:00 SGT · sent by CC · Aside (Claude Sonnet 5.5 via the user's Claude login)
Message sent: "Read this session archive first, then follow the sub-agent instructions, use my claude code account". Two files were attached: the session archive (handoff JSON) and the sub-agent brief below.
```
Launch four subagents, using Claude Sonnet for all four agents. Assign each agent the following role and responsibilities.
Role: Team Lead / Coordinator

Tim is the central point of coordination between me and the other three agents.

Responsibilities:
- Collaborate directly with me to evaluate progress, discuss findings, and decide the next course of action.
- Coordinate the other agents while they work on their respective tasks.
- Monitor progress and ensure everyone is working towards the Week 6 assignment requirements.
- Receive and consolidate feedback from Rev (Reviewer).
- Translate Rev's feedback into clear, actionable next steps for Art.
- Communicate QA findings, priorities, and required changes to Art.
- Bring important decisions, blockers, and questions to me rather than making assumptions about my intent.
Initial instruction: While the other agents are working, Tim takes ownership of coordination and keeps the overall workflow moving. Do not wait passively for agents to finish before identifying the next steps.
Role: Assignment Compliance & Requirements Specialist

Stick has a deliberately restricted knowledge scope. Treat this agent as having no prior memory or context.

Permitted knowledge sources ONLY:
- Professor Roh's Week 6 assignment instructions.
- The remaining relevant eLearn course content.
Responsibilities:
- Independently interpret the assignment requirements.
- Identify explicit instructions, deliverables, constraints, and evaluation criteria.
- Check whether the work complies with the professor's expectations.
- Flag missing requirements, unsupported assumptions, and deviations from the assignment.
- Provide Tim with precise, evidence-based findings.
Critical restriction: Do not use previous conversations, external research, other agents' assumptions, or general knowledge to fill gaps. If something is not supported by the permitted course materials, explicitly flag it as unknown rather than inventing an answer.
Role: Design & Implementation

Resume the design task you were previously working on.

Responsibilities:
- Continue from the existing progress rather than restarting or unnecessarily reworking completed work.
- Follow the Week 6 assignment requirements and relevant course materials.
- Implement the design while preserving the existing direction and established decisions.
- Receive QA feedback and next-action instructions from Tim.
- Address identified issues and report completed changes back to Tim.
- Flag ambiguities or decisions that require my input.
Role: Independent Quality Assurance & Adversarial Reviewer

Use the Adversarial Review skill to critically evaluate Art's output.

Responsibilities:
- Independently assess the work against the Week 6 assignment requirements.
- Challenge assumptions and actively look for weaknesses, omissions, inconsistencies, and potential failure points.
- Evaluate both the quality of the output and its compliance with the assignment.
- Avoid giving positive feedback merely to validate the work.
- Grade the output and justify the assessment with specific evidence.
- Provide Tim with:
  1. Overall grade and rationale.
  2. What works well.
  3. What is incorrect, incomplete, or weak.
  4. Critical issues that must be fixed.
  5. Prioritized, actionable next steps for Art.
Rev must remain independent and objective. The purpose is to identify problems before the work is considered complete.
Use the following communication structure:

Stick → Tim: Assignment interpretation, requirements, and compliance findings.

Art → Tim: Design progress, implementation updates, and blockers.

Rev → Tim: Independent assessment, grade, QA findings, and recommended next actions.

Tim → Art: Consolidated QA feedback, priorities, and implementation instructions.

Tim ↔ Me: Collaboration, decisions, clarification, and approval of important next steps.

Tim is responsible for ensuring that feedback is translated into action rather than simply being circulated between agents.
1. Follow the assignment: Professor Roh's Week 6 instructions take precedence over assumptions or personal preferences.
2. Preserve existing progress: Art should resume the current task, not restart it.
3. Maintain independent perspectives: Stick focuses on compliance, Art on execution, and Rev on adversarial evaluation.
4. No fabricated context: Agents must distinguish between verified requirements, interpretations, and unknowns.
5. Iterative QA: Art should address Rev's critical findings through Tim, followed by another review where necessary.
6. Human decision-making: Tim collaborates with me on consequential decisions instead of silently making choices that could change the direction of the work.
Proceed in this order:
1. Launch all four Sonnet subagents and assign their respective roles.
2. Have Stick review the Week 6 assignment and relevant eLearn materials.
3. Have Art resume the existing design task.
4. Have Rev prepare to evaluate the output using the Adversarial Review skill.
5. Tim coordinates the parallel work, consolidates findings, and identifies decisions requiring my input.
Do not consider the assignment complete simply because Art has finished implementation. Completion requires assignment compliance, an independent adversarial review, and resolution of critical QA findings.```
**What came back:** Aside launched Stick, Art, Rev and Tim on claude-code/claude-sonnet-5-5 (Aside credits were out, so the earlier aside/claude-sonnet-5 route was not used). Stick finished first: prototype not yet compliant (real brand names in A, no AUDIT/PROMPTS/REFLECTION in the build folder, thin debrief, Shift+V toggle flagged).
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** Kept Tim as a subagent as written. Added a rule that Rev's method is written into his prompt, because Aside has no Adversarial Review skill. Real-brand finding and the Shift+V toggle go to the user as decisions.
**Principle check:** none: production only (process). AI-collaboration evidence for REFLECTION A1/A3 (an AI reviewer overruling our own build).

## Entry 30 - track the three .md deliverables from this chat on · 2026-11-08, about 04:00 SGT · sent by CC · Aside
```
Keep a track of the deliverables too Prompt.md, audit.md, and the other thing from this chat onward. If I say "DQ" meaning Dumb Question, it does not go to prompt md
```
**What came back:** This folder: TRACKER.md (status of AUDIT.md, PROMPTS.md, REFLECTION.md) and this log.
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** Read "the other thing" as REFLECTION.md (the third required file, slide 12). Logging each non-DQ prompt as it arrives; DQs are skipped.
**Principle check:** none: production only.

## Entry 31 - brand names in Version A: keep SMU, eLearn to WeLearn, remove D2L Brightspace · 2026-11-08, about 04:10 SGT (approx; exact time not captured) · sent by CC · Aside
```
SMU --> It's Super Management University nit the Singapore One, close, but not a compliance miss

eLearn --> Change to WeLearn

D2L Brightspace --> Remove
```
**What came back:** In a.html, "eLearn" became "WeLearn" in 262 places (page title now "Homepage - Your University - WeLearn"). All 60 "Powered by D2L Brightspace" footers were deleted. No visible "Brightspace" text is left. Internal /d2l/ paths and brightspace API URLs in hidden attributes were left alone so the screens keep working. The first browser check still showed "eLearn" because of a cached copy; a cache-bypassing reload showed WeLearn.
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** Edited a.html even though an earlier rule said not to touch it, because the user gave this instruction explicitly. A backup of the old file is in the session tmp folder. Told Tim that SMU is not a compliance issue. OASIS (33) and IITS (6) are still in a.html, and B is named "Learnly" while A is now WeLearn. Both are left for the user to decide.
**Principle check:** none: production only (compliance with the brief's no-real-brand rule). Note for REFLECTION A1: Stick read "SMU" as a real brand; we corrected that call.

---

## Entry 32 - answers to Tim's decision 1: B is WeLearn, keep OASIS and IITS in A · 2026-11-08, about 04:10 SGT (approx; exact time not captured) · sent by CC · Aside (relayed from Tim)
```
B should be called WeLearn; keep OASIS and IITS in A
```
**What came back:** In b.html all 8 "Learnly" strings became "WeLearn" (a backup is in the session tmp folder). The one "SMU Learn" string in index.html (the router's page title) became "WeLearn". OASIS (33) and IITS (6) are untouched in a.html. Tim was told.
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** A and B now share one brand name, which removes a naming confound between the variants. OASIS and IITS stay because the user decided they are part of the fictional story. Art's "one string" design made this a single replace.
**Principle check:** none: production only (consistency between A and B, Week 10 heuristic 4).

---

## Entry 33 - answer to Tim's decision 2: state the confound in the paper and rebuild B on A's content, rearranged · 2026-11-08, about 04:25 SGT (approx; exact time not captured) · sent by CC · Aside (relayed from Tim to Art)
```
We'll state it on the paper; Do rebuild B on A's content. but move them around, I want the end result easy to compare, but it should still be better than what we have on version A
```
(The user's second paragraph in this message was marked DQ and is not logged.)
**What came back:** Tim was given a six-point spec for Art: B takes A's courses, readings, dates and counts; same brand WeLearn; same modules in the same nav places; only the audited elements differ in substance; Rev's round 2 fixes stay; the week label and the Finish overlap get fixed. Rev re-tests afterwards.
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** This replaces Tim's default of "state in paper, no rebuild". The paper still states the remaining confound under Limits. The tree decision, paper re-scope, random A/B, repo route and Shift+V are still open.
**Principle check:** none: production only (comparability of A and B; Week 10 heuristic 4).

---

## Entry 34 - one site only; the toggle changes the view and the URL (/?v=A, /?v=B) · 2026-11-08, about 04:20 SGT (approx; exact time not captured) · sent by CC · Aside
```
I only want one site. The toggle should change the view and the URL from /?v=A and /?v=B
```
**What came back:** The router already served both versions at one address, and the Shift+V toggle already changed the view and the URL (checked in the browser: /?v=B to /?v=A and back, toggle stays on). The gap was that /a.html and /b.html still opened as separate pages. Both now redirect to /?v=A or /?v=B. Also relaunched Tim and Art after both runs ended in errors (timeout, connection error).
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** The guard is the first script in each file's head, so the router, which loads these files into its own page, is not affected. Art was told to keep it. Backup copies of other files in the folder (b_snapshot.html and similar) are not part of the product and stay out of the repo.
**Principle check:** none: production only (brief: one Production URL, ?v=A and ?v=B).

## Entry 35 - four more QA rounds, then push to GitHub, delete old code, fix the Vercel deployment · 2026-11-08, about 04:30 SGT (approx; exact time not captured) · sent by CC · Aside
```
do 4 more rounds of such iterations; then push to github; delete all old code, then fix the vercel deployment issue
```
**What came back:** Tim was told to run four more rounds (Art builds, Rev re-tests, Tim consolidates, Stick rechecks in rounds 2 and 4) and to send a go/no-go. The GitHub push, the old-code deletion and the Vercel fix are done by the parent after that. Results: see the entries below as they land.
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** This lifts the earlier two-round limit. The push, the deletion and the Vercel step were authorised explicitly in this message. AUDIT.md, PROMPTS.md, REFLECTION.md, README.md and SCOPE.md are not "old code" and are kept.
**Principle check:** none: production only.

**Result for Entry 35 (about 05:00 SGT):** Four QA rounds done (Tim, Art, Rev, Stick). Rev's final grade on Redesign: Competent, no severity 3 or 4 items left. Pushed index.html, a.html and b.html to public/ on main as c-c-for-code (3 commits: the upload, a guard fix so /a and /b redirect to the router, and a README rewrite). Deleted the version-a-elearn/ folder (257 files; history keeps it). Vercel: the earlier "Deployment Blocked" came from commits authored by Aarti's account, because the Hobby plan blocks deployments from non-owner authors; commits by c-c-for-code deploy fine. Live site checked: /?v=A, /?v=B, the toggle and the /a and /b redirects all work.

## Entry 36 - "I dont want to see this" (screenshot of the consent screen "Before you start") · 2026-11-08, about 05:10 SGT (approx; exact time not captured) · sent by CC · Aside
```
I dont want to see this
```
(Attached: a screenshot of the router's consent screen with the Continue button.)
**What came back:** The consent screen showed on every new visit because consent was remembered only for the browser tab session. In the local copy of index.html it is now remembered across visits (localStorage as well as sessionStorage), so it shows once per browser. A first-time visitor still sees it. Tested locally: accept once, then a new session opens straight to the page. Not pushed yet.
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** The Week 6 brief requires a consent screen before the prototype, so I did not remove it. The question of removing it for the author only, and of pushing this change to the live site, was put to the user.
**Principle check:** none: production only (brief slide 8 on consent).

## Entry 37 - the tree card should be the first thing seen; use the comments in the paper draft to change the site · 2026-11-08, about 05:20 SGT (approx; exact time not captured) · sent by CC · Aside, then Art
```
This part should be the 1st thing they should see, and check out the coments in this doc, see if that helps make changes to the site
```
(Attached: a screenshot of the "Your term, leaf by leaf" tree card on B's Home, and the term paper draft DecisionArchitectureForManagers.docx with 37 comments by CC.)
**What came back:** Read all 37 comments. Most are edits to the paper itself (tone, fluff, citations, limitations). The ones that bear on the site: B should proactively help students decide instead of recording activity; AI personalisation; SMU tools scattered and rarely used; making learning a habit (Duolingo as reference, Csikszentmihalyi flow); secondary navigation below the masthead in the main content area; screens chosen by usability. Art was given a five-point spec: tree card first on Home (left on desktop, top on mobile), a tree that reads as living at low counts using real data only, a front-end-only "Study helper (sample)", course tabs below the masthead, and immediate feedback.
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** The paper comments were not applied to the paper; the paper was not touched. The Study helper comes back (Art cut it earlier for lack of an audit finding); it now traces to the comments on personalisation and scattered tools, and goes in AUDIT.md "Added after building". No real brand name, no text input, no network calls.
**Principle check:** W2 goal gradient and flow (clear goal, immediate feedback); nudge with an opt-out (the helper is dismissible and never opens by itself).

---

## Entry 38 - colours too strong, go back to the site's blue and white, and cut the words · 2026-11-08, about 05:40 SGT (approx; exact time not captured) · sent by CC to Art (relayed by Aside) · Claude Sonnet 5.5
```
Also, Art, check out the colors. They're too strong, they're not aesthetic. The green, dark green on the side pane is too much of a dark green. Why don't you find something else, maybe get a better sense of color theory and then revisit this. The blue on top, it looks completely out of place. Instead of keeping it green, let's still maintain the existing site's color structure, which is blue and white. In that sense, can we kinda recreate what we have here? For the illustrations and everything, yeah, you can go ahead and make those color choices, it's okay. But overall, I do feel it's a little too wordy, the entire application.
```
**What came back:** Art was given a round 6 spec combining this with Rev's round 7 findings. Colour: A's blue and white, the team's earlier blue (#2C557F actions, #3A6EA5 accent, #CFE0F0 selected), no dark blocks, white or very pale side pane, white masthead, soft illustration colours, 60-30-10 and contrast of at least 4.5 to 1. Words: cut about half, show the count once, short side pane lines. Rev's items: tree animates once per session, a visibly healthy tree (one visible leaf per done item, one visible bud per item to do), the Study helper loses its unsupported claim and invented minutes, the A/B pill must not cover the tabs.
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** The user chose blue and white earlier too (31 Oct, based on Mehta and Zhu 2009 on blue and approach). Rev round 7 graded Redesign Competent at the lower edge; it is re-tested after this round.
**Principle check:** W8 colour (blue for approach, low arousal; reduce saturated colour); W1 fluency (less text lowers effort).

## Entry 39 - Stick: what is still needed to complete the assignment; draft the term paper as the brief intends; Tim makes sure the comments are addressed · 2026-11-08, about 06:00 SGT (approx; exact time not captured) · sent by CC to Stick and Tim (relayed by Aside) · Claude Sonnet 5.5
```
Okay, stick, what else is needed to complete this assignment? Go ahead and complete it, do a full iteration until the assignment is complete. Also draft the term paper, not how I share it to you, but how it is supposed to look like based off what you are aware of, which is the term six, sorry, week six slides. The comments that I've made, Tim, it is your job to ensure that those comments are addressed in whatever Stick produces. In case Stick pushes back because it's what the term paper says, then let me know.
```
**What came back:** Pending. Stick was given three tasks: a completion checklist, a term paper draft (slide 13 structure, about 3,000 words, .md and .docx) and drafts of REFLECTION.md and an AUDIT.md addendum. Tim builds a 37-row comment tracker and runs up to four fix rounds, and reports any conflict between a comment and the brief to the user.
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** Stick's restriction on outside knowledge stays, but he may use project material (the group draft, the 37 comments, the repo notes, Art's and Rev's reports). One real source was added for the attention-span comment: Rosen, Carrier and Cheever (2013), checked on ScienceDirect. Nothing is pushed to the repo or the paper's final file until the user approves, because the three .md files in the repo hold teammates' text.
**Principle check:** none: production only. AI collaboration evidence for REFLECTION: the compliance agent is restricted to the brief and must flag conflicts instead of obeying silently.

## Entry 40 - responsiveness: study how Slack's web app lays out, and cut the empty space · 2026-11-08, about 06:20 SGT (approx; exact time not captured) · sent by CC to Art (relayed by Aside) · Claude Sonnet 5.5
```
Also, for the responsiveness alone, right, art, take a look at how slack the web application is looking like, 'cause this kind of is starting to look similar to that. I don't want too much negative spacing as what we have here.
```
**What came back:** Pending (Art round 8). Art was told to measure Slack's responsive behaviour by layout only (no messages read or saved), then apply a denser 8px scale, an icon rail at about 1000px and a drawer at 700px, content filling the width, and no dead bands. Round 7 (Rev's two severity 2 items) finished just before: time left in plain words restored ("in 2 days"), hero and tree now name their scope.
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** Privacy limit added because Slack holds the user's real conversations. The Slack look is a reference for density and breakpoints only, not to copy its brand or colours.
**Principle check:** W1 cognitive load / fluency (denser, scannable lists); W8 colour unchanged.

**Result for Entry 39 (about 07:00 SGT):** Stick delivered stick_completion_checklist.md, a term paper draft (about 3,136 body words, six-section structure, live and repo URLs on page 1, .md and .docx with 4 tables and 2 figures), REFLECTION_draft.md (about 1,100 words), AUDIT_added_after_building_draft.md and stick_pushback.md. Tim checked all 37 comments: 35 addressed, 2 not applicable (notes to the user), no pushback needing the user. Comment 32 (Duolingo as habit proxy) conflicts mildly with the brief's A/B metric requirement, so the paper keeps the A/B test and adds the Duolingo study beside it. Aside removed the real school name that Stick had written on page 1 and refreshed Figure 2 from the current B.
**Result for Entry 40:** Art measured Slack by layout only (rail 70px, sidebar 327px at 1440 shrinking to 179px, main pane fills the rest, list rows 28px) and applied a denser scale to B: 8px grid, rows 44px, icon rail from 701 to 999px, drawer at 700px and below. Empty background share of the first screen fell from 11.7 to 7.1 percent at 1440x900.

---

## Entry 41 - commit to main and deploy to Vercel · 2026-11-08, about 07:15 SGT (approx; exact time not captured) · sent by CC · Aside
```
Commit to main and deploy to vercel
```
**What came back:** index.html and b.html were uploaded to public/ on main through GitHub's web upload as c-c-for-code (commit "B restyle: blue and white, tree first on Home, denser responsive layout; consent remembered per browser"). Vercel built it with a green status; the live site shows the new B. Live checks: consent shows first on a fresh browser, /?v=B and /?v=A load, the Shift+V toggle changes the URL and the view, /b redirects to /?v=B, no console errors. a.html, the three .md files, SCOPE.md and vercel.json were not touched. The paper, REFLECTION and AUDIT drafts are not in the repo.
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** Shift+V toggle and the original consent wording are still live; the user did not decide on them. Pushing as the owner avoids the Hobby-plan block that hit Aarti's commits.
**Principle check:** none: production only.

---

## Entry 42 - copy the layout and placements of the team's earlier draft-2 site · 2026-11-08, about 07:30 SGT (approx; exact time not captured) · sent by CC · Aside, then Art
```
https://super-smu-test-draft-2.vercel.app/#b/myhome was perfect in layouts and palcements, fix ours
```
**What came back:** Pending (Art round 9). Aside opened the reference and wrote down its structure: white top bar with wordmark; floating rounded sidebar card with search, icon nav with count badges, Other resources, Pinned courses and the user chip at the bottom; large page title with a date line; a Coming up grid of cards with course pill and relative-days pill; a Deliverables timeline with a Today line; My courses rows with progress and next item; at 390px a 50px icon rail. Art was told to copy layout and placement only, with our content and blue and white palette, and to keep the tree card first on Home.
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** The reference contains a real name and characters' names; none are copied. It has no tree, so the tree stays first by the user's earlier instruction; this is flagged to the user as a decision. Web fonts cannot be loaded (no network calls), so a system font stack replaces Geist.
**Principle check:** W1 fluency (familiar structure, consistent placement); Week 10 heuristic 4 (consistency and standards).

**Result for Entry 42 (about 08:00 SGT):** Art rebuilt B's shell, Home and course pages to the reference's layout and placements with our content and blue and white palette (white top bar, floating sidebar card with search and Pinned courses, tree card plus This week first, Coming up cards, Deliverables timeline, My courses rows; course nav now in the sidebar; rail at 64px from 701 to 1199px and 50px at 700px and below). Not copied: Dashboard (no matching screen), Discussions list (no posts in A), the soft-red overdue pill (kept neutral for no loss framing), all person names. Local only, not pushed. Rev re-test requested through Tim. Side note: Tim created a local git repo (branch test_Chak, one commit) inside repo-ready from a block of work the user never requested; it was stopped and the .git folder is left untouched.

## Entry 43 - side pane: only Home and the subjects · 2026-11-08, about 08:40 SGT (approx; exact time not captured) · sent by CC to Art (relayed by Aside) · Claude Sonnet 5.5
```
Art - too much options on the sidepane; just keep it Home and the subjects on the sidepane
```
(Attached: a screenshot of B's icon-rail sidebar at 900px wide with about a dozen icons.)
**What came back:** Pending (Art round 11). The sidebar is cut to Home plus the four subjects; the other screens stay reachable from inside a course and from Home. Rev's round 10 items went in with it: drawer keyboard and screen reader fixes, Finish hidden while the drawer is open, one h1 on Home.
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** This also answers Rev's finding that the reference layout over-offered navigation (Week 10 heuristic 8: one primary action per screen). Previous rounds: Rev round 9 and 10 graded Redesign Competent (firmer); Art's round 10 replaced the 50px rail with a menu button and drawer at 500px and below.
**Principle check:** W1 choice overload (fewer options at the point of choice); Week 10 heuristic 8.

**Result for Entry 43 (about 09:00 SGT):** Sidebar now holds only Home and the four subjects (code, short name, thin bar, "x of y"), plus the user chip. Course pages carry their own tab bar (Home, Content, Assignments, Quizzes, Discussions, Classlist, My results) under the course header. Rail at 701 to 1199px shows Home and the four course tiles; drawer at 500px and below. Drawer keyboard fixes and one h1 on Home included. Checked by Aside at 1440 and 900 wide on Home and the Assignments tab, no console errors. Not yet re-tested by Rev; not pushed.

## Entry 44 - one "Home" only, fewer cards on the course page, drop the copyright block · 2026-11-08, about 10:40 SGT (approx; exact time not captured) · sent by CC to Art (relayed by Aside) · Claude Sonnet 5.5
```
Compare this against the Vercel site we have deployed. I love this much better. Except for the side pane, I don't want to see home there again, and then when I click on a course, I see home again, Keep only 1. And there are too many cards in particular to this screenshot. Can we kind of do something about it? And the copyright and academic integrity, I don't think it needs to be shown at the bottom over there. And
```
(Attached: a screenshot of B's course Home tab with the tab bar, three stat tiles, Coming up cards, Timeline, Learning tools, Announcements and the Copyright block. The message ends after "And".)
**What came back:** Pending (Art round 12). Reading of the message: Home appears in the sidebar and again as the first course tab, so only one stays. The sidebarhttps://github.com/c-c-for-code/super-management-university/blob/main/PROMPTS.md keeps Home and the course tab becomes "Overview". Cards are cut to at most 4 bordered blocks on the course Overview, and the copyright and integrity block goes from every B screen.
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** The unfinished last sentence was reported to the user. The comparison to the deployed site: the local version has the reference layout, a short sidebar, tab bar under the course header and the timeline; the deployed version is still the earlier blue and white build.
**Principle check:** W1 choice overload and fluency (fewer blocks per screen).

**Result for Entry 44 (about 11:00 SGT):** Sidebar keeps the one Home; the course tab bar starts with "Overview" (same route, so the A to B mapping holds). Course Overview now has 4 bordered blocks (summary strip, Coming up rows, Timeline, collapsed More) instead of about 8 cards; global Home has 5. The copyright and academic integrity block is removed from every B screen. Committed to the local test_Chak branch only, not pushed. Checked by Aside at 1440 wide on Home and the course Overview, no console errors.

## Entry 45 - fix the icons, keep the user profile at the bottom, check against eLearn for what is missed · 2026-11-08, about 11:30 SGT (approx; exact time not captured) · sent by CC to Art (relayed by Aside) · Claude Sonnet 5.5
```
http://127.0.0.1:8770/?v=B-- Fix the icons, keep the profile at the bottom, the user profile, currently it's missing. Check against eLearn to see what else we have missed.
```
**What came back:** Pending (Art round 13). Aside's check before sending: the profile chip shows at the bottom of the sidebar at 1440 wide but is missing in the icon rail (701 to 1199px) and the drawer. Art was told to put the profile at the bottom at every size with a small popover, audit and unify the icons, and build a gap table against version A (header links, help, calendar, last login, groups, grades), fixing cheap gaps without growing the sidebar.
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** "Fix the icons" was read as consistency and visibility (the user did not say which icons). Real brand names and invented features stay out. Anything large that B lacks is listed as MISSING rather than invented.
**Principle check:** Week 10 heuristic 4 (consistency and standards); heuristic 1 (visible status, unread items).

**Result for Entry 45 (about 12:00 SGT):** The profile was hidden by the rail CSS; it is now a button at the bottom of the sidebar at every size (chip, avatar only in the rail, row in the drawer) with a popover (last login sample line, Profile, Account settings, Notification settings, My progress, Help, Sign out, all sample only). Icons unified (one stroke width, 20px nav, 18px rows). Top bar has Other resources, Messages (99+ from A's unread discussions) and Updates popovers. Groups sits under Classlist and Grades under My results. Gap table against A is in art_notes.md (links only, no screens, for ePortfolio, Locker, Competencies, Awards, Class Progress, Media Gallery, Surveys). Checked by Aside at 1000 wide, popover open, no console errors. Committed to local test_Chak, not pushed; Rev has not re-tested.

## Entry 46 - Other resources as a full-height side pane with a dimmed (not blurred) page and a search bar · 2026-11-08, about 12:20 SGT (approx; exact time not captured) · sent by CC to Art (relayed by Aside) · Claude Sonnet 5.5
```
Open this as a full-out side pane on the right side, something similar to this one. Don't reuse that same component, but something like this, where there's a, a side pane from the left side appearing, and the main content area on the rest of the screen is slightly grayed out, not grayed out blurred or like tinted away, so that the focus is on the side pane with the options. And I like the fact that you moved all the links in that side. Also, move it, keep it that side, and have a search bar, so that way the users can go to that option, search for whatever tools they normally have on eLearn, but consolidated at that spot.
```
(Attached: a screenshot of B's "Other resources" popover with Links, Tools and Help, and a screenshot of another product's help side pane, used only as a pattern.)
**What came back:** Pending (Art round 14). Reading: the user wrote "right side" first and "left side" later; the pane is built on the right. It is a full-height pane about 420px wide with a light tinted dim and no blur, a search field with live filtering and synonyms, one column of 44px rows grouped Links, Tools and Help, and dialog accessibility (focus trap, Esc, outside click, focus return).
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** The reference shows a real company's brand; only the layout pattern is used, none of its name, colours or words. The pane is the consolidated place for the tools the user normally reaches in eLearn.
**Principle check:** W1 choice overload (options behind one door with search); Week 10 heuristic 7 (flexibility and efficiency: search to the option).

**Result for Entry 46 (about 12:40 SGT):** The grid icon now opens "Other resources" as a full-height pane from the right edge (420px; full width minus 16px at 390px), over a flat dark tint with no blur. It has a close button, a "Search tools" field (focused on open, live filter by label and keywords, empty state with Clear search, Enter opens the first result), and 20 items in one column of 44px rows under Links, Tools and Help. Dialog accessibility: focus trap (30 Tabs stayed inside), page behind inert, Esc, close button and outside click close it, focus returns to the grid button, Finish hidden while open. Checked by Aside at 1440 wide: opened, typed "mark" (Competencies and Class progress shown), no console errors. Committed to the local test_Chak branch, not pushed; Rev has not re-tested.

## Entry 47 - "Remove this" (the consent screen "Before you start" again) · 2026-11-08, about 13:00 SGT (approx; exact time not captured) · sent by CC · Aside
```
Remove this
```
(Attached: a screenshot of the router's consent screen with the Continue button. Second time the user objected to it; the first was Entry 36.)
**What came back:** In the local index.html the consent screen is skipped when the page is opened on 127.0.0.1 or localhost, so the author's review never shows it. On any other address (the Vercel site) the screen still appears once per browser. Tested: fresh storage on localhost goes straight to B. Committed to the local test_Chak branch; not pushed.
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** The Week 6 brief requires a consent screen before the prototype, and Stick flagged it. Removing it from the live site would be a requirements miss, so the skip is limited to the local preview and the live site's behaviour is left for the user to decide explicitly.
**Principle check:** none: production only (brief: consent screen, then A or B, then debrief).

## Entry 48 - masthead icons behave like the Other resources pane; bigger Home icon; Home as tabs; quiz results page like a reference; Content reference to follow · 2026-11-08, about 13:20 SGT (approx; exact time not captured) · sent by CC to Art (relayed by Aside) · Claude Sonnet 5.5
```
Fix the other two icons on the masthead to behave the same way the other resource's side panel, how that appears and how it looks like. The home icon is a little small when compared to the courses ic-icons, so try to make it a little bigger. It's okay if there's extra space. You can that's fine. And try to keep this behavior consistent. So, for the home page, can you have something like this, instead of keeping it top-down? As for the content itself, a couple chats ago I shared you mobbing references. Over there I noticed one particular reference, we can use that for the content tab selection and preview. I'll share screenshot later.


Screenshot #2: I want the quiz results apge to show something like this
```
(Attached: a screenshot of B's course tab bar, and a screenshot of a quiz results page from another learning product with a score, a band chart, a percentile line and an answers list.)
**What came back:** Pending (Art round 15). Readings of the message: "something like this" for Home = the horizontal tab bar of screenshot 1, so global Home becomes Overview, Timeline, Courses and More tabs with Overview first; Messages and Updates open the same right side pane as Other resources; the Home tile in the rail matches the course tiles; the quiz results page follows screenshot 2 (score, band chart, insight line, answers accordion, sticky Retake bar). The Content tab is not touched until the user sends the reference.
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** The reference shows a percentile and "better than 53% of learners", plus an attempts-limit notice. Both are left out: rankings, peer comparison and urgency break the prototype's own rules (no fake popularity or rankings, no loss framing). The student sees only their own score against fixed bands. The reference's brand is not used.
**Principle check:** W2 goal gradient / feedback (score against fixed bands, next step); W4 framing (own score, no social comparison); Week 10 heuristic 4 (the same pane for all masthead icons).

**Result for Entry 48 (about 14:00 SGT):** Messages, Updates and Other resources share one right-hand pane (own title and search each); the Home tile in the sidebar, rail and drawer is 40x40 like the course tiles; global Home has tabs Overview, Timeline, Courses, More (state in #/home/<tab>, arrow-key navigation); the quiz results page (#/course/MGMT6108/results/<q1|q2|q3>) has a score, four fixed bands with the score band highlighted, an insight card, an answers accordion and a sticky Retake bar, with no percentile, ranking or attempt limit. A only lists the quizzes (Part 1 to 3, attempts 1/1) and shows no scores, so every score and question is a labelled sample value (Part 1 9 of 10, Part 2 9 of 12, Part 3 7 of 10). Committed to the local test_Chak branch (not pushed). Content tab untouched, waiting for the user's reference screenshot.

## Entry 49 - the AI-assisted practice quiz, refactored into the app's design language · 2026-11-08, about 14:10 SGT (approx; exact time not captured) · sent by CC to Art (relayed by Aside) · Claude Sonnet 5.5
```
The practice version, the AI assisted one, that looks something like this, refactor to suit the exisitng design language of the app
```
(Attached: IS624_Quiz1_Simulator.html, the user's own quiz practice tool for another course. It was read for structure only and not edited or copied into the repo.)
**What came back:** Pending (Art round 16). A Practice button on the Quizzes tab opens a practice flow: mode rows (quick, weak spots, one section), an optional timer that is off by default, one question at a time with a "Your thinking" box and a "Not sure" flag, a results screen by section with "Retry the ones I missed", and a front-end-only Study helper (sample) in place of the "copy results for an AI" step. Eight generic sample questions on MGMT6108 topics replace the file's question bank.
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** The file's IS624 questions are real course material for another course and stay out of the prototype and the repo. Its countdown timer with a red low-time state would break the "no urgency timers" rule, so the timer is optional, student-set and neutral. No AI runs in the prototype; the helper is canned and labelled.
**Principle check:** W2 goal gradient and feedback (progress through the set, results by section); W4 framing (own results, no ranking); W3 expectations (the student sees what each mode does before starting).

**Result for Entry 49 (about 14:50 SGT):** A Practice button on the Quizzes tab opens #/course/MGMT6108/quizzes/practice: mode rows (Quick practice of 8, Weak spots, One section, optional neutral Timer off by default), one question at a time with "Your thinking" and "Not sure", a results screen with by-section bars, a missed-only filter and "Retry the ones I missed", and a Study helper (sample) with three canned chips. Eight new generic sample questions in two sections; nothing from the IS624 file was copied. History lives in memory and resets on reload. Checked by Aside at 1440 wide (start screen, no console errors, no IS624, Aside, Claude or Gemini text on the page). Committed to the local test_Chak branch (not pushed); Rev has not re-tested rounds 12 to 16.

## Entry 50 - when it is ready, commit this as version B on GitHub and deploy on Vercel · 2026-11-08, about 15:30 SGT (approx; exact time not captured) · sent by CC · Aside
```
When it's ready, commit this as version B on github, deploy on vercel
```
**What came back:** "Ready" was checked first. Rev's release check (round 11, 29 routes at 1440 and 390, 14 at 1100 and 900) said GO on two fixes: the quiz results page had a rising curve that read as a percentile chart, and the practice Study helper said one section had more misses when the bars were tied. Art fixed both and the minor items (neutral grey-blue badges, one sticky bar at a time on small screens, timer label, "Nothing is saved" note, start menu on Practice re-entry). Aside re-checked the results page and scanned b.html for brand names (all zero). Then index.html and b.html were uploaded to public/ on main as c-c-for-code ("Version B: redesign on A's content (tabs, side panes, practice, results bands)"); Vercel status is green. Live checks: consent shows first on a fresh browser, B opens with the tree and the one primary button, the Practice screen opens, Shift+V to A lands on A's Quiz List, no console errors. a.html, the .md files, SCOPE.md and vercel.json were not touched. The local test_Chak branch holds the same code (latest cb9c972) and is not pushed as a branch.
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** Pushed straight to main because the user said "commit this ... on github" and main is what Vercel deploys. The consent skip is localhost only, so the live site still shows consent once per browser.
**Principle check:** none: production only.

## Entry 51 - delegate manual review to teammates: recreate the notes format as a Version A "As is / To be" document with a table of contents · 2026-11-08, about 16:30 SGT (approx; exact time not captured) · sent by CC · Aside
```
I need to delegate some tasks that require manual review to my human team mates, sorry Tim. Can you recreate this in this format. 
Have a table of contents ready, refer screenshot 2 this for the sections 

Section title (h1)
URL (body): you provide this from the vercel site
As is (h2): the thigns that don't work go here
To be (h2): the live eLearn site pasted as refernce

Do the same for all URLs for version A alone. Based on this site: https://super-management-university.vercel.app/?v=B#/course/MGMT6108/readings
```
(Attached: "Dec Arch Notes (1).docx", the team's notes with five screenshots, and a screenshot of the module split table: five people, module, what to look for, course weeks.)
**What came back:** A Word file, Version_A_As_is_To_be_review.docx (about 6 MB), with a title, the module table, a table of contents of 76 clickable section titles, and one section per Version A page (76, all of them): Heading 1 title with a person prefix (P1 to P5, or Shared), the Vercel address (https://super-management-university.vercel.app/?v=A#/<page>), As is (Team notes taken from Dec Arch Notes plus items auto-detected from A's captured pages), a Reviewer notes line, and To be (the live eLearn link and a screenshot). 67 live screenshots were captured from the signed-in eLearn session with the user's name and photo masked. Nine pages have no screenshot: Classlist, Groups, Account and Profile show other people's or personal details, and five Class Progress pages need the signed-in user id.
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** The five modules in the screenshot define the grouping; ten pages that match no module are listed as "Shared". Auto-detected items come from static analysis of A's click handler (links that show "Not captured yet", controls with no action, search boxes with no code) and are labelled for manual confirmation. The file contains real eLearn screenshots, so it is marked internal and kept out of the repository.
**Principle check:** none: production only (team coordination).

## Entry 52 - assume the screens in the Word documents will exist in Version A; build the counterpart screens in Version B, local only, in the existing design language · 2026-11-08, about 17:00 SGT (approx; exact time not captured) · sent by CC to Art (relayed by Aside) · Claude Sonnet 5.5
```
perfect. Now, using what is there on those Word document as reference, I want you to assume that those screens will exist in version A, because someone else is working on those changes. I want you to make the changes locally only for version B screens. And the version B screens, refactor it in the existing design language we have.
```
**What came back:** Pending (Art round 18). Reading: "those Word documents" are the team's Dec Arch Notes and the Version A review document (76 pages with live eLearn references). Art builds a B counterpart for every page B lacks (learning tools, class progress, competencies, awards, surveys, media gallery, repository search, calendar, announcements, classlist and groups with masked names, discussion topic and subscriptions, quiz submissions, Work To Do, ePortfolio family, locker, account and profile as read-only summaries), updates the A to B toggle mapping, and leaves the Content tab for the user's pending reference screenshot.
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** Local only: nothing is pushed or deployed. Real staff names and SMU branding in the live screenshots are not copied; sample data and masked names are used. Account and profile are read-only because the prototype rules forbid fields for name, phone, email or card.
**Principle check:** Week 10 heuristic 4 (the same layout and shell on every screen); W1 fluency (consistent placement across the new screens).

**Result for Entry 52 (about 18:30 SGT):** Art built 38 new B screens (My Attendance, Peer Evaluation, Journal, INSIGHT; Class progress summary and four detail screens; Competencies; Awards; Surveys; Media gallery; Repository search and results; Calendar and the Course Schedule event; Announcements; Groups; Discussion topic and Subscriptions; Quiz submissions for three quizzes; Work to do; ePortfolio with five tabs; Locker; Account settings and Profile as read-only summaries), masked the Classlist names, made the Home actions menu open, and added the Shift+V mapping for each. Rev's check (38 routes at 1440 and 390, 35 Shift+V round trips): GO. One severity 2 item was fixed: Class progress said "complete" for the syllabus, reintroducing audit Finding 4; it now says "Opened". Awards shows an empty state; selected tab scrolls into view at 390; Back links on Account and Profile. Content tab untouched, waiting for the user's reference screenshot. Separately, the user sent Art a weekly "This week" agenda file directly; Art replaced the Home Timeline and course Overview timeline with it. All local only (test_Chak, not pushed).

## Entry 53 - check branches; push to test_Chak only; confirm Vercel is linked only to main; do not redeploy · 2026-11-08, about 18:40 SGT (approx; exact time not captured) · sent by CC · Aside
```
check what branches exist; push changes only to test_Chak branch; confirm that vercel deployment is linked only with the main branch, but do not redeploy
```
**What came back:** GitHub has only main (no test_Chak). Vercel's Production environment tracks main only; the Preview environment tracks all unassigned branches with the Ignored Build Step on Automatic, so a new branch would trigger a login-protected Preview build. Nothing was pushed and nothing was changed on GitHub or Vercel. The user was offered three options (skip builds on other branches then push; push and accept one Preview build; keep test_Chak local).
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** Pushing a branch would have created a deployment, against "do not redeploy", so the push was held for the user's pick.
**Principle check:** none: production only.

## Entry 54 - pause for an account switch; then resume all tasks on Sonnet, commit to test_Chak for audit, share the localhost link, do not deploy · 2026-11-08, about 19:00 SGT (approx; exact time not captured) · sent by CC · Aside
```
Pause, let me switch accounts
All sonnets, resume the tasks; commit to test_Chak branch for audit purposes/team's reference. But share me the localhost link for review, do not deplot
```
**What came back:** Agents relaunched on Claude Sonnet 5.5 (Rev x2, Art x1, resumed). The earlier Hallmark polish and the new Content tab were reviewed: Rev round 13 and 14 (GO/NO-GO) found 'Untitled activity' reverted, a 'Zoom' wording, a monetary e$10 incentive, a real building code and smaller items; Art fixed all of them. Local commits on test_Chak: e3a3003 (polish and Content) and 69355cf (review fixes). Not pushed to GitHub (no remote on the local repo; a push would create a Vercel Preview build) and nothing deployed.
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** "Commit for audit/team reference" was read as a local commit because the push and deploy question was still open. The team cannot see the branch until it is pushed.
**Principle check:** none: production only.

---

## Entry 55 - no deploy and no push to main; share the localhost link; push only after Aarti commits the Version A replicas in a new branch · 2026-11-08, about 19:10 SGT (approx; exact time not captured) · sent by CC · Aside
```
don't deploy to vercel or push to main. Just share the localhost link, we can coorindate changes here, we push only *after* Aarti commits the version A replicas in a new branch
```
**What came back:** Link shared. Nothing was pushed or deployed. Work stays on the local test_Chak branch (latest commit 69355cf, clean tree). The sequence agreed: Aarti commits the Version A replicas to a new branch, then B is pushed.
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** Pushing now is on hold, so the Vercel Ignored Build Step is left on Automatic and GitHub still has only main. Open for later: a branch push creates a login-protected Vercel Preview build unless that setting is changed first.
**Principle check:** none: production only.

## Entry 56 - add colour, find a design repo online for feedback, improve the UI with it, and the UX with Stick's decision-science principles · 2026-11-08, about 19:30 SGT (approx; exact time not captured) · sent by CC to Art (relayed by Aside) · Claude Sonnet 5.5
```
Art, add some colors, see how you can make it better, find a design repo online to give yourself better feedback, imprive the UI with that, and the UX with the decision science principles from Stick
```
**What came back:** Pending. Stick (restricted to the Week 6 brief, the course folder copy and AUDIT.md) writes a per-screen UX principle brief; Art researches one or two public design-guidance repos (text only, nothing installed), critiques the current B, adds a muted multi-hue palette with course identity colours, polishes the UI, and applies Stick's low-risk moves. Local only: b.html on the local test_Chak branch; no push, no deploy.
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** The earlier colour feedback ("too strong") is respected: muted accents, no red for deadlines (W8, no loss framing), contrast checked. Every UX move must trace to an audit finding or a stated principle and pass a sludge check; the audited A/B elements stay intact so the test still works.
**Principle check:** W8 colour (blue approach, red avoidance; saturated colour raises arousal); W2 goal gradient; W7 fluency; W4 framing; nudge-not-sludge on every move.

## Entry 57 - click the tree to see progress; use the Figma comments on intermittent reinforcement and XP points that grow the tree; show the course readings page · 2026-11-08, about 20:30 SGT (approx; exact time not captured) · sent by CC · Aside, then Art and Stick
```
I want to be able to click on the tree and then see the progress, and check the Figma file that I had earlier. I left some comments on intermittent reinforcements and s- kind of XP points based on which the tree will grow. I want to see the course readings page as well.
```
**What came back:** The Figma file (AwaC1Y4cFrUVcmlZbE6IjU, frame 6:7) has 17 comments by the user; the relevant ones: "#14 Intermittent reinforcement, the apple falls down randomly. Picking it up earns double points", "#15 Streaks", "#13 Progress visualized, instant feedback", "#16 Radial graph showing completion stat", "#17 Say 2 completed ... if starting out. Say 2 more to go if near the end". Built in Version B (local only): the tree card is a button that opens a "Your tree" side pane (XP total, five growth stages, one term-level radial graph, per-course rows, how the tree grows, active days this week, Rewards on/off switch); XP toasts; the tree grows by stage; a bonus apple appears after about 1 in 3 real actions (guaranteed within 4) and pays double XP, with no timer, sound or loss; and a Course Readings page (#/course/MGMT6108/course-readings) listing the 18 real course readings from the course folder, starting at 0 of 18 read, where opening does not mark a reading read.
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** Stick (restricted to the course sources) rated the apple SLUDGE-RISK, XP and the tree GREY, and active days, the radial and the microcopy NUDGE; nothing in the course files supports intermittent rewards or points as helping learning ("not in sources"). Two changes followed: opening a topic gives no XP (it repeated the audit flaw that opened is not read), and the pane states the apple rule in plain words next to the switch. The apple stays as the user's own design decision, disclosed as grey in the paper. XP, the apple and active days exist only in B, so they sit outside the A/B measures M1 to M3.
**Principle check:** W2 goal gradient and instant feedback (kept); autonomy (Rewards switch); the brief's trap "a dark pattern relabelled as a nudge" (disclosed, bounded, switchable).

**Result for Entry 57, paper follow-up (about 21:30 SGT):** The user sent the team a revised paper draft (DecisionArchitectureForManagers_Revised.docx). Stick graded it Diagnosis Competent, Redesign Complete to Competent, Evidence Competent; Rev graded it Diagnosis Excellent-level, Redesign Competent (describes a gamified B that was not built), Evidence Competent, AI Competent; both recommended Stick's 6-section draft as the base. Aside approved a merge: term_paper_draft_v2.md and .docx (body 2,953 words by Stick's count, 2,865 by Tim's; six sections plus preface and conclusion; Appendices A to C; six tables, two figures), merge_log_v2.md and REFLECTION_draft_v2.md (about 1,195 words, A3 updated). Dropped as unverifiable: Sana, Nickerson, Wood and Runger, Bastani, Buil, Hick, Sweller, Mathur. Open for the team: variable-schedule statement (from class notes, tagged "[team to verify]"), reading years for Nodder, Ariely, Kahneman and Alter (the PDFs are scans), severities are proposals, the "490 to 200 words" figure is stale. Figure 2 was replaced with a current screenshot of the local B Home.

## Entry 59 - show the tree progress in the main content area (not a side pane); tree fills the viewport; no card beside it; bring the timeline back; simplify · 2026-11-08, about 22:30 SGT (approx; exact time not captured) · sent by CC to Art (relayed by Aside) · Claude Sonnet 5.5
```
This is nice, but I don't want to see the, when I click on the tree, I don't want to see it from the side pane. I want to see it in the main content area within that screen. And ensure the tree occupies the full viewport. I don't want to see it, tree and then shared by the other card on the right. Instead, have the tree and clicking on the tree opens up the right side with the content there. Timeline, whatever we had before, is, is gone. I want to bring that back. I don't want to have this visualization. It's too complex.
```
(Attached: a screenshot of the tree progress side pane over Home.)
**What came back:** Home Overview: the tree fills the main content area; the "This week" card is now a slim row inside the tree stage (count, next due date, the one primary button) so the audited primary action stays; clicking the tree opens the progress as an inline column on the right of the same screen (no overlay, no dim, no focus trap); the progress content is cut to XP and stage with one bar, "3 of 8 done", per-course rows, three "how it grows" lines, a 7-dot "Active this week" row, the Rewards switch with the apple rule, and the sample note (radial graph, stage list and XP table removed). The "This week" day-by-day agenda is shown again on Home below the tree, plus the Timeline tab. Committed locally on test_Chak; not pushed.
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** Two readings made: "timeline" was taken to mean the day-by-day "This week" agenda; the older marker timeline (dots on a week axis) was not rebuilt, and "this visualization... too complex" was taken to mean the progress pane's radial graph and tables. Open question put to the user.
**Principle check:** W2 goal gradient and instant feedback (tree plus the count visible at once); fluency (one thing per screen).

**Paper follow-up (about 23:30 SGT):** Another Stick instance (bJEJO7UaB4WtzRak, working on the user's revised docx comments) asked for online research; Aside relayed it to Tim, who checked the 13 references in paper v2 (all real; 6 peer-reviewed; four used inaccurately) and listed public Brightspace and university AI sources. Stick (qIsV02r23jaLj8yA) applied six accuracy fixes to term_paper_draft_v2 (Nielsen scale attribution, Labrecque & Milne scope, Rosen sample wording, Alter chapter numbers removed, DOIs added, real vendor and university names kept out of the body); body 2,980 words. Appendix C (AI tools table) was removed from v2 pending a team decision, so the AI-collaboration evidence now rests on REFLECTION_draft_v2.md. The user's attachment was not edited by Aside.

## Entry 60 - seven design changes: solid-fill tabs, full-height blue sidebar with white main area, tree encoding (branches are subjects, leaves are readings, fruits are quiz results), remove "Read as text", Home Courses tab becomes Practice with mock quizzes per subject, Timeline course dropdown, global dismissible announcement banner with popup · 2026-11-08, about 23:45 SGT (approx; exact time not captured) · sent by CC to Art (relayed by Aside) · Claude Sonnet 5.5
```
#1 - I don't like this pill shape. Make it a, solid fill
#2 - Change the sidepanel to cover top down fully, use blue instead of white; use white for the main content area that's currently blue
#3 - Each branch is a subject, the leaves and fruits are readings and quiz results
#4 - I don't want to see this.
#5- No need to show courses again, call this Practice, and have the AI do mock quizzes for the subjects. similar to the html file. Let the "quiz" tab inside a course remain so only for the university uploaded quizzes
#6 - Under timeline,have a dropdown for the course selected.
#7- Announcements Should appear as a dismissible banner right below the masthead each time an announcement happens, allowing users to see the announcement and be aware of it without having to be on the homepage wherever they are in the application. Clicking on an clicking on that collapse, that carousel, dismissible banner should open a popup that shows the announcement in full display.
```
(Attached: seven screenshots: the active tab pill, the floating sidebar card, the tree, the "Read as text" popup, the Home Courses tab, the This week agenda, and the area under the masthead.)
**What came back:** Pending (Art round 27). Readings made: #1 the active tab becomes a solid blue fill with a small radius; #2 the sidebar is full height, blue, with the logo inside it, the masthead only over the main area, and the main area white; #3 four branches (MGMT violet, BUS teal, MKT-2 amber, MKT rose), leaves are readings read, fruits are quiz results, assignments are not drawn, and only MGMT6108 has readings and quizzes in A, so the other branches stay bare with a "nothing yet" tag; #4 the visible "Read as text" is removed and a screen-reader-only text alternative is kept; #5 the Courses tab is renamed Practice with a subject picker and per-subject mock quizzes (labelled "No AI runs here. Questions are pre-written", because the brief forbids model calls), and the Practice button leaves the course Quizzes tab (university quizzes only); #6 a course dropdown on the Timeline agenda; #7 a dismissible announcement banner below the masthead on every screen, a carousel with manual arrows, and a modal showing the full announcement; one clearly labelled sample second announcement makes the carousel demonstrable.
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** The word "AI" in #5 is kept honest: the prototype cannot call a model (front end only, no model calls). New question banks for BUS200 and the two Digital Marketing courses are generic sample questions, labelled as such.
**Principle check:** W2 goal gradient (branches and fruit show the subject-level state); W7 fluency (one tab style, one banner place); W4 framing (announcement is calm information, no urgency).

**Entry 60 outcome (resumed 8 Nov):** Art built all seven changes (commit 559df3d). Rev round 27: layout, banner, tabs, tree, Practice, Timeline pass; verdict NO-GO only because XP, the bonus apple, the Rewards switch (on by default) and the Active-this-week strip are present (Rev R27-1 to R27-3). Those are the user's own earlier decisions, so they were kept and put to the user. Fixed afterwards: count wording, announcement facts from A, Space key, tree text legibility, Practice reset, Finish bar padding, "Start a mock quiz" (Art 27b/27c, committed locally).

## Entry 61 - commit to test_Chak, pull Version A from test_Aarti, make every A screen have a B equivalent · 2026-11-08, about 00:10 SGT (approx) · Claude Code (Aside) with Rev and Art · Claude Sonnet 5.5
```
okay, commit to test_chak branch. Pull in changes from test_Aarti branch fir version A, let's ensure every verison A has an equivalent versoin B
```
**What came back:** Round 27 was already committed (c8affd1). Fetched origin (read-only): `test_Aarti` (07464b0) changes only `public/a.html`; copied that file into test_Chak (a867a39), byte-identical to Aarti's branch (git diff empty). Rev parity audit: 4 MISSING, 14 PARTIAL, 16 EXACT in grouped rows; main gaps were the three placeholder courses XXX101 to XXX103 (B still had BUS200 and two MKT300), View All Courses dialog, alerts, classlist, some Shift+V mappings. Art round 28 closed them (5ecc69f): 149 A ids checked, 109 EXACT, 40 PARTIAL (kept on purpose: A's grades error page, five external tools share one sample page, global Awards/Competencies map to course pages, MGMT6108 modules inline on Content), 0 MISSING; round 28b fixed three Rev mismatches.
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** `index.html` edits were needed for the Shift+V mapping, so they were included now that parity is asked for. Nothing pushed.
**Principle check:** consistency between A and B so the study compares like with like.

## Entry 62 - capture Workbench V2.0 master search and spacing in B · 2026-11-08, evening SGT (approx) · sent by CC to Art (relayed by Aside) · Claude Sonnet 5.5
```
Check out this prototype for the master search feature, and check out how the spacing works in this prototype, between elements on the front end as well as pop-ups, visuals, interactions, dropdowns. I want this kind of captured in our version B.
```
(Attached: Workbench_V2.0_21Oct.html, read-only.)
**What came back:** Art measured the prototype (study in agents/workbench_study.md), applied its spacing, timings and menu/dialog rhythm to B while keeping B's palette, density and radius, and rebuilt Cmd+K/"Search everything" as one scoped component. Also fixed Rev R29 findings (Updates pane, sample labels, count-up announcements). Committed locally.
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** its look (palette, orb, glass) was not imported; B stays dense per the earlier less-empty-space instruction.
**Principle check:** W7 fluency (one search component, consistent rhythm); honesty (invented numbers labelled sample).

## Entry 63 - replace main with test_Chak, commit to GitHub, deploy on Vercel · 2026-11-08, late evening SGT (approx) · Claude Code (Aside) · Claude Sonnet 5.5
```
replac everything on main brnach , commit to github, deploy on vercel
```
**What came back:** index.html, a.html and b.html on `main` replaced with the test_Chak versions (commit 7578f28, author Chak so the Hobby plan builds it). Pushed to `main` (65d7c2d to 7578f28). Vercel built it as Production: Ready. Anonymous fetch of the live site returned 200 for /, /b.html, /a.html, with B search and XXX101 present. AUDIT.md, PROMPTS.md, README.md, REFLECTION.md, SCOPE.md and vercel.json on main were left as they were (stale). test_Aarti 756655f (newer A) not included.
**Principle check:** explicit user authorisation for the production push.

## Entry 64 - fix the font and the visual QA issues, redeploy; announcements in a different colour; disfluency · 2026-11-08, about 19:05 SGT (approx; exact time not captured) · sent by CC · Aside
```
Update my prompt.md and the other necessary files from my end first.
Then, Fix the font and the visual QA issues and redeploy. Keep the announcements in a different color; disfluency for the user to think and pay attention

Use a consistent font throughout. Geist

This part shouldn't hit the Overview button
```
(Attached: three screenshots: the banner with a dark-blue line under it, the course title in a serif face, and the course header bar touching the Overview tab.)
**What came back:** Art replaced the serif display face with Geist everywhere in B (font file served from the same site, /fonts/Geist-Variable.woff2); the announcement banner and its popup became amber, distinct from the blue UI, with no urgency wording; the course header bar now stops 16px above the tab bar; extra visual fixes at 1440, 1100, 900 and 390 (no console errors, no overflow, lowest contrast measured 5.77:1). The parent checked 10 routes (every element on them uses Geist, no external requests) and the 390 view. This entry also covers the repo-documents update that preceded it (PROMPTS.md Entries 29 to 63 added, AUDIT.md "Added after building", REFLECTION.md, README.md and SCOPE.md updated in the local checkout; nothing committed by Stick).
**Our judgement, and what we changed next:** Kept the amber banner as an intentional attention cue; the Home count and the blue primary button stay the dominant items. The Geist file comes from the group's own Workbench prototype (Geist is an open font).
**Principle check:** [to confirm] W7 fluency: deliberate disfluency to slow processing and prompt more careful thinking; W8 colour: a distinct colour so announcements are noticed. The check is whether announcements stay calm information with no urgency or loss framing, and whether any added friction serves the student's goal.

## ## Entry 65 - Version B ClassList and student profiles · [date from your records] · sent by [Ashwin] · [Aside]

~~~~text
Do not change anything in Version A. Make the following changes only in Version B.

Version A has ClassList and Groups inside the class information tab, but Version B is missing this tab. Add a new Version B tab named ClassList that combines the ClassList and Groups experience.

Retain the ClassList page and student roster. When a user clicks a student's name, open a detailed profile within the same page instead of redirecting to Outlook or another browser page. Use a nested profile view, expandable panel, or another intuitive layout that preserves access to the ClassList.

Include these profile sections:

A. Personal and Academic Information
- Full name and profile photograph
- Degree programme and academic specialisation
- University email address and phone number, where available
- LinkedIn profile and personal portfolio
- Academic year, graduation date, and other relevant academic details

B. Academic History
- Courses previously taken
- Current courses and relevant academic interests
- Academic projects, research, and achievements, where available

C. Class Groups and Collaboration
- Class groups, project teams, or study groups the student belongs to
- Names of other students in each group
- Current projects and collaboration interests
- Skills the student can contribute to group projects
- Areas where the student is interested in collaborating with others

D. Personal and Professional Interests
- Career goals and professional interests
- Skills and areas of expertise
- Extracurricular activities and interests
- Optional social media accounts and other relevant professional links

E. Communication and Networking
- Clearly accessible email and contact options
- Ways to connect with classmates through relevant channels
- A clear distinction between publicly visible profile information and private contact details

## Entry 66 - Version B behavioural science and student engagement · 2026-11-08, about 22:05 SGT (approx; exact time not captured)· sent by [Ashwin] · [Aside]
~~~~text
Do not change anything in Version A. Make the following changes only in Version B.

Upgrade Version B with behavioural design that encourages students to reflect on their assumptions, engage meaningfully with learning materials, and maintain progress towards academic commitments. Preserve Version B's current functionality, visual identity, navigation, and working interactions unless a change is requested below. Behavioural-science terms are for documentation only. Do not show them as student-facing labels or content.

1. Optional reflection prompts
Add relevant, open-ended questions at selected points in the portal. Vary their order. Make answering optional, and let students navigate and complete tasks without responding. Do not use blocking pop-ups, forced responses, or mandatory checkpoints. Present questions subtly, such as in reflection cards or expandable sections. Example: “What is one assumption you currently hold about this topic? What evidence might challenge it?”

2. Processing feedback
Show contextual indicators while the portal is actually processing an action, such as “Preparing your learning materials...” or “Updating your progress...”. Connect indicators to real application states and remove them when processing finishes. Do not simulate processing, add artificial delays, or imply that the system is reasoning when it is not.

3. Incremental learning progress
Add a progress indicator within the existing Content tab. Base it on actual completion data and update it as students complete lessons or activities. Where appropriate, show the change from previous progress with concise messages.

4. Dashboard for pending academic commitments
Add a Dashboard tab that brings together pending content lessons, assignments, quizzes, and other academic activities. Show available task names, statuses, deadlines, and remaining effort. Include a non-intrusive indicator of outstanding work that updates as tasks are completed. Use neutral, supportive language. Do not fabricate deadlines, penalties, or consequences, and do not restrict access to other features.

5. Navigation
Move ClassList so it appears immediately below Discussions. Preserve the relative order of other existing tabs unless specified otherwise. Add Dashboard while keeping existing tabs and functionality.

6. Consistency and validation
Keep Version B's visual identity, accessibility, and responsive behavior. Implement these changes only in Version B and leave Version A untouched. Verify that reflection prompts are optional, processing indicators reflect real activity, progress is based on real completion, Dashboard information updates correctly, and navigation is in the requested order.

Initial design notes in the source document also proposed open-ended questions to challenge assumptions, visible progress in Content, processing messages, and a Dashboard progress view. Keep the final interface optional, evidence-based, and non-coercive.

## Entry 67 - Discussions and ClassList redesign · 2026-11-08, about 22:10 SGT (approx; exact time not captured)· sent by [Ashwin] · [Aside]

~~~~text
Act as a senior UX/UI and product designer specialising in learning management systems. Redesign the Discussions and ClassList tabs to make them more intuitive and usable while retaining existing functionality and academic context.

1. Discussions
Keep the existing Discussions landing page and forum list. Inside a forum, replace the small fixed-position thread and content boxes with one larger, organised interface. Use a nested thread-and-reply layout, or a two-panel layout with thread navigation on the left and the selected discussion on the right. Provide enough space for long discussions and adapt to different screen sizes.

Make it easy to move between threads without losing the user's place. Include search, sorting, filtering, reply functionality, and clear indicators for unread discussions, new replies, and the selected thread.

Show overdue and approaching-deadline notifications in the website's main notification area, not only inside a course. Also make it easy to enrol in new classes, modules, and workshops.

2. ClassList and profiles
Keep the ClassList roster. When a user selects a student's name, open that student's profile within the same page instead of redirecting to Outlook or another browser page. Include:
- Personal and academic information, such as programme, specialisation, academic year, and relevant contact or portfolio details where available
- Academic history, current courses, interests, projects, research, and achievements where available
- Class groups, project teams, collaboration interests, and skills the student can contribute
- Personal and professional interests, skills, activities, and relevant links
- Communication options, with a clear distinction between public profile information and private contact details

3. UX and visual requirements
Use a clean, professional university design with consistent styling across both tabs. Prioritise readability, accessibility, spacing, visual hierarchy, and intuitive navigation. Support desktop, tablet, and mobile. Avoid unnecessary pop-ups, clutter, and excessive navigation. Use realistic sample data and do not expose sensitive information. Show profile fields only when the information is available and the student has permission to share it.

4. Prototype deliverable
Create a high-fidelity interactive prototype with a redesigned Discussions landing page, an improved forum view, navigable nested threads, a searchable ClassList, in-page student profiles, and functional navigation between Discussions and ClassList. Demonstrate working interactions, not just static mock-ups. Keep it a practical upgrade to eLearn rather than an entirely different platform.

5. Behaviour, social norms, and collaboration
Encourage participation, knowledge sharing, constructive feedback, and collaborative problem-solving through non-intrusive nudges. Reduce cognitive load and help students take small steps towards academic and collaborative goals.

Use positive social norms carefully. Highlight helpful contributions and thoughtful feedback, but avoid public rankings, excessive competition, or pressure that could discourage students. Make new and less-active students feel welcome.

Help students find classmates with complementary skills, shared interests, and similar goals. Support discussion with follow-up questions, constructive response prompts, and opportunities to share different perspectives. Support individual and collaborative learning.

6. Colour and implementation
Use a light, professional academic palette with accessible contrast. Use colour consistently for selected items, unread discussions, collaboration opportunities, and successful interactions. Avoid excessive colours, heavy gradients, dark backgrounds, and distracting elements.

Build these principles into real prototype interactions. For each major design decision, explain the student challenge it addresses, the principle used, and how it helps without unnecessary pressure or manipulation.
